## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS/CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

```html
 I learned how to use the right element to structure this project.
```
```css/scss
$breakpoints: ("small": 23.4375em,"xtra-large": 90em);
@mixin breakpoints($size) {
 @media(min-width: map-get($breakpoints,$size)){
  @content;
  }
}

@include breakpoints(small){
  ...
}

sass partials
```

### Continued development

HTML/CSS/JS/SASS - 
These areas that I want to continue focusing on my future projects and still not completely comfortable with.


### Useful resources

- [css](https://www.developer.mozilla.org) - This helped me for CSS reason. I really liked their pattern and will use it going forward.
- [css](https://www.w3schools.com) - This is an amazing website which helped me finally understand HTML/CSS. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
